Tricks of the Trade

This app aids users in stock interactions, providing a seamless stock exchange experience.

Interactions:

stock has many transactions
user has many transactions
transaction belongs to a stock and to a user

User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to enter a stock name and be returned information about that stock.
2. As a user, I want to be able to purchase and sell stock (create transactions).
3. As a user, I want to be able to create my account.
4. As a user, I should be able to update my balance & contact info.
5. As a user, I should be able to favorite the stocks I want to follow.
6. As a user, I should be able to delete favorited stocks.
7. As a user, I should be able to read my balance, which is updated in real-time.

Stretch Goals:

1. Stock values should return real-time stock data.
2. Users should be able to recall information on previous transactions.
3. Interactable ??? (How can we create a user interface?)
